In this chapter, the experimental setup done will be discussed.

\section{Part A: Classification of the Cardiotocography dataset}
In this problem, experiments were carried out in an ubuntu 18.04 system, using python 3.7.3 and with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz as the CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M as the GPU.

The imports used in this problem is shown in Listing \ref{ls:p1}.
