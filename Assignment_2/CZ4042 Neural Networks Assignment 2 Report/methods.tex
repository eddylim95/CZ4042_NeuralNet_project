In this chapter, the experimental setup done will be discussed.

\section{Part A: Object Recognition of the CIFAR-10 dataset}
In this problem, experiments were carried out in a google colab virtual machine (VM), using python 3.x and CPU clock of 2.3 GHz and Tesla K80 as the GPU, with 12GB gpu ram (specifications obtained from \cite{carneiro2018performance}).

The imports used in this problem is shown in Listing \ref{ls:p1}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption= Imports used for problem 1, label=ls:p1]
import math
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pickle
from tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm
import sys
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Part B: Text classification of Wikipage entries}
Similarly in this problem, experiments were carried out in a google colab virtual machine (VM), using python 3.x and CPU clock of 2.3 GHz and Tesla K80 as the GPU, with 12GB gpu ram (specifications obtained from \cite{carneiro2018performance}).

The imports used in this problem is shown in Listing \ref{ls:p2}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption= Imports used for problem 2, label=ls:p2]
import numpy as np
import pandas
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import csv
import time
from tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm
\end{lstlisting}
